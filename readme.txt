Tumblrize is a small and convenient Wordpress plugin to post to Tumblr and Posterous. All you need is a Tumblr account.


== Description ==

Tumblrize is a small and convenient Wordpress plugin to post to Tumblr whenever you hit the "publish" button. It uses Tumblr's simple API.

It's lightweight, it just requires you to input your tumblr email and password in the plugin editor screen.

After that, you're ready to cross-post!

Posterous is an option.


== Installation ==


   1. Download the zip file: Tumblrize (v 1.2)
   2. Unzip the file in your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
   3. Go to your wordpress administration panel and activate the plugin
   4. Go to Tumblrize Options and edit your Tumblr login and password
   5. That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the plugin double posting? =

Tumblrize posts to Tumblr whenever you publish or update a post. If you update a post, It will be published to Tumblr again.

= Can I specify tags? =

Not yet.

= I checked the Posterous box for the first time, what happens next? =

It will either create a new Posterous blog if you hadn't one yet, and send exactly the same content to Tumblr and Posterous.
Posterous will probably find it suspicious at first, asking you by email to confirm your post.

Tumblrize will use your Tumblr email login for Posterous.
