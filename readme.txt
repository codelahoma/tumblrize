Requires at least: 2.6
Tested up to: 3.0.1
Stable tag: 1.4.3

Tumblrize crossposts your published WordPress entries to Tumblr and Posterous. All you need is a Tumblr account. Changes you make to your WordPress posts are reflected in your Tumblr posts.

== Description ==

Tumblrize posts to Tumblr whenever you hit the "publish" button. It uses Tumblr's simple API to keep posts in sync; when you edit your WordPress post, it updates your Tumblr post.

Tumblrize is very lightweight. It just requires you to input your Tumblr email and password in the plugin's options screen. After that, you're ready to cross-post!

Other options allow posting to Posterous, sending additional metadata from your WordPress entry (notably tags), to Tumblr, and more.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin file.
1. Unzip the file into your 'wp-content/plugins/' directory.
1. Go to your WordPress administration panel and activate the plugin.
1. Go to Tumblrize Options (from the Settings menu) and provide your Tumblr login information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I specify tags? =

Yes. WordPress's tags are also crossposted to Tumblr. Be certain you have enabled the "Add post tags, too?" setting in the plugin's option screen.

= I checked the Posterous box for the first time, what happens next? =

It will either create a new Posterous blog if you hadn't one yet, and send exactly the same content to Tumblr and Posterous. Posterous will probably find it suspicious at first, asking you by email to confirm your post. Tumblrize will use your Tumblr email login for Posterous.

= Can I send older WordPress posts to Tumblr? =

Yes. Go edit the desired post, verify the crosspost option is set to `Yes`, and update the post. Tumblrize will keep the original post date.

= What if I edit a post that has been tumblrized? =

If you edit or delete a post, changes will appear on Tumblr accordingly.

= Can I cross-post Private posts from WordPress to Tumblr? =

No. Currently Tumblrize only supports cross-posting public posts (i.e., posts with the status of `publish`). If you would like support for private posts, please [contact us](http://tumblrize.ijulien.com) to let us know, or indicate your feature request on [our issue tracker](http://github.com/meitar/tumblrize/issues/).

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.3 =
* Support for YouTube's `<iframe>` style embed code.
* Fix use of short open tags to use full `<?php` style open tags.

= 1.4.2 =
* 5/9/2010: v.1.4.2 - Re-enables user-specific credentials, fixes bug in plugin-wide credentials option fallback.

= 1.4.1 =
* 4/9/2010: v.1.4.1 - Disables per-user specific credentials; workaround crendentials issue.

= 1.4 =
* 13/4/2010: v.1.4 - New feature: Multiple author support for shared Tumblr blogs.
** WordPress users can override the plugin's default Tumblr credentials with their own account information. Tumblrize uses the user-specific credentials to crosspost content and associate it with the appropriate Tumblr user. If no user-specific credentials are entered, Tumblrize falls back to the plugin-wide settings.
** Improve clarity, grammar, of an error message.
** Fix bug where uninstall routine failed to clear the category exclusion options.

= 1.3.6 =
* 30/10/2009: v.1.3.6 - Select categories that will never be crossposted. Useful if you also use another crossposting plugin like Twitter Tools and you don't want to create an endless crossposting loop.
** Allow Tumblr Post Type to be edited if the post has not yet been crossposted yet (i.e., if the post doesn't have an associated Tumblr post ID).
** Continual minor code cleanup.

= 1.3.5 =
* 24/10/2009: v1.3.5 - Added Video Support. If you use YouTube's embed code in your WordPress post body, it'll send the URL to Tumblr which will generate the code.

= 1.3.4 =
* 24/10/2009: v.1.3.4 - Scheduled posting is now supported. This effectively mimics the Tumblr queue feature.
** Fixed bug where deleting a post on WordPress did not delete the right post on Tumblr.
** Fixed bug where timezone differences resulted in incorrectly dated Tumblr post. Fixed by using UTC time for everything. Make sure both your Tumblr blog and your WordPress blog are using the same timezone.
** Improved error handling. Tumblrize will warn you of authentication failures, connection errors, and some other potential issues.
** Other minor bugfixes.

= 1.3.3 =
* 22/10/2009: v1.3.3 - Post date is taken into account. This will help older WordPress posts not to be posted to Tumblr as new entries. To tumblrize an old post, go edit and update it with Tumblrize checked.

= 1.3.2 =
* 20/10/2009: v1.3.2 - New features:
** Link, Audio, and Quote Tumblr Post types support added.

** Individual post option override added. Override default plugin settings on a per-post basis.
* Minor code cleanup.

= 1.3.1 =
* 19/10/2009: v1.3.1 - Improved options screen, significant code and database access enhancements.

= 1.3 =
* 18/10/2009: v1.3 - New features:
** Post editing. When you edit a WordPress post that has been previously cross-posted to Tumblr, Tumblrize will update Tumblr with the new information.
** Post deletion. When you delete a WordPress post that has been previously cross-posted to Tumblr, Tumblrize will delete that post from your Tumblr blog to keep both blogs up-to-date.
** Tag support added. WordPress post tags become Tumblr post tags.
** Photo post type support added. Tumblrize will search for the first instance of an `<img>` tag in your post if 'Photo' is selected as the Tumblr Post Type and use it as the photo source of the Tumblr post.
* Uninstallation support. Tumblrize will clean up after itself if you uninstall it, removing your Tumblr login credentials from your database. This improves your security.
* Significant code cleanup.

= 1.2.4 =
* 29/09/2009: v1.2.4 - Prevents double posting: if the post is updated, the update won't be sent. Switch off Tumblr but post on posterous. Added a tags option.

= 1.2.3 =
* 29/09/2009: v1.2.3 - You can now get notifications by email when Tumblrize has sucessfully posted. You can also add a link to the original article redirecting to your WordPress blog, and turn off the plugin if needed.

Maintaining this plugin is a labor of love. However, if you like it, please consider [visiting Julien's website](http://log.ijulien.com/), or [purchasing one of Meitar's web development books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26redirect%3Dtrue%26sort%3Drelevancerank%26search-type%3Dss%26index%3Dbooks%26ref%3Dntt%255Fathr%255Fdp%255Fsr%255F2%26field-author%3DMeitar%2520Moscovitz&tag=maymaydotnet-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957). We appreciate your support!

Known issues include:

* Tumblrize only supports YouTube video, not Vimeo videos.
* If you delete a WordPress post, Tumblrize will not honor the individual post override to crosspost to Tumblr. That is, deleting a WordPress post that has been crossposted will delete its mirror post on Tumblr as long as global Tumblr support is enabled in the options screen.
* Crossposting the Quote post type is a little buddy. Patches welcome.
* Some error messages persist longer than they should. If you see a warning, such as one stating that your username or password is not entered, try simply updating again. Re-submitting the options form seems to fix this.
